## Case Overview

The city of Visakhapatnam was shaken by the tragic death of **Veena**, a young woman who ended her life along with her six-month-old baby boy.  
Before taking this extreme step, she wrote a **nine-page handwritten letter** describing the relentless domestic abuse and dowry harassment she faced from her husband and in-laws.

## Veena’s Final Words

In her final letter, Veena wrote:

> **“He promised me love, but after marriage, his true nature came out. He behaved well in front of others but always asked me for more dowry. His family supported him. I don’t want anyone else to suffer like me. Think carefully before marriage.”**

These words reflect:

- Deep emotional trauma  
- Daily threats and humiliation  
- Constant pressure for more money and dowry  

Veena lived in silent suffering, her pain largely invisible to the outside world.
