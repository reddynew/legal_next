# Case Overview

The city of Visakhapatnam was shaken by the tragic death of **Veena**, a young woman who ended her life along with her six-month-old baby boy.  
Before taking this extreme step, she wrote a **nine-page handwritten letter** describing the relentless domestic abuse and dowry harassment she faced from her husband and in-laws.

Her story is heartbreaking — and tragically, it mirrors the experiences of many women across India.

## Marriage Background

Veena, a native of **Komarada Mandal**, married **Uma Maheshwar Rao** on **23 January 2024** in what began as a love marriage.

Her family gave:

- **₹20 lakh in cash**
- **Five tolas of gold**

Although the marriage started on a seemingly normal note, Veena’s life soon descended into emotional and financial exploitation.

## Veena’s Final Words

In her final letter, Veena wrote:

> **“He promised me love, but after marriage, his true nature came out. He behaved well in front of others but always asked me for more dowry. His family supported him. I don’t want anyone else to suffer like me. Think carefully before marriage.”**

These words reflect:

- Deep emotional trauma  
- Daily threats and humiliation  
- Constant pressure for more money and dowry  

Veena lived in silent suffering, her pain largely invisible to the outside world.

## What the Investigation Revealed

During the investigation, the police found that:

- Her husband, a school teacher in Anakapalli district, **repeatedly demanded additional dowry**.  
- He allegedly **considered marrying another woman** purely for financial gain.  
- Veena **rarely confided** in her parents or others, enduring the abuse alone.

The emotional burden and continuous harassment eventually pushed her beyond her limit.

## Legal Action Taken

After the tragedy, the police registered a case against **Uma Maheshwar Rao** and **four of his relatives** for:

- **Harassment**
- **Abetment to suicide**

**DSP Sravani** stated that the investigation is ongoing and assured that strict legal provisions will be applied against those responsible.
