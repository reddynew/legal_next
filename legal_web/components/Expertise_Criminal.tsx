          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
            Bail is a <em>legal provision</em> allowing temporary release of an accused person during trial after arrest.
             Anticipatory Bail, a significant aspect of <em>criminal law in India</em>, serves as a preventive remedy under 
             Section 482 of  <abbr title="Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2024">BNSS</abbr>, enabling a person to seek bail before arrest. Through its <em>criminal law</em> <em>consultation
              services</em>, <span className="font-bold text-black">JP Law Suvidha</span> facilitates access to experienced bail and anticipatory bail lawyers <em>ensuring prompt, strategic, and dependable legal representation</em>.</p>
          <h4 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold leading-relaxed mt-4">Types of Bail</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
            <li><em>Regular Bail</em> – granted after arrest in bailable and non-bailable offenses.</li>
            <li><em>Anticipatory Bail</em> – sought in anticipation of arrest.</li>
            <li><em>Interim Bail</em> – temporary bail pending final decision.</li>
            <li><em>Default Bail</em> – granted if investigation exceeds prescribed time limits.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold leading-relaxed mt-4">Legal Provisions</h4>

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
            The accused or a representative can apply for bail. Anticipatory bail applications are filed when the applicant
            fears arrest for a non-bailable offense. <strong>JP Law Suvidha</strong> supports 
            clients with <em>online criminal lawyer</em> consultation, <mark>digital legal help</mark>, and preparation of documentation needed for

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
            Applications are filed before the Sessions Court or High Court under Section 482 of <abbr title='Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2024'>BNSS</abbr>. Courts assess reasons for apprehension of arrest, antecedents, and gravity of allegations. Once anticipatory bail is granted, police must release the applicant on bail upon arrest. <span className="font-bold text-black">JP Law Suvidha</span> ensures clients understand all conditions and legal obligations attached to bail.
