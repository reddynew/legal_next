          <p className="text-gray-800 mb-3">
            Bail is a legal provision allowing temporary release of an accused person during trial after arrest. Anticipatory Bail, a significant aspect of criminal law in India, serves as a preventive remedy under Section 438 CrPC, enabling a person to seek bail before arrest. Through its criminal law consultation services, <span className="font-bold text-black">JP Law Suvidha</span> facilitates skilled bail lawyer and anticipatory bail lawyer access for fast, strategic, and reliable legal assistance.

          </ul>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">Legal Provisions</h3>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">Who Can Apply?</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-800 mb-3">
            The accused or a representative can apply for bail.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">How to Secure Bail</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
            <li>Engage skilled legal counsel experienced in judicial trends.</li>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">Process for Anticipatory Bail</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-800 mb-3">
            Applications are filed before the Sessions Court or High Court under Section 438 CrPC. Courts assess reasons for apprehension of arrest, antecedents, and gravity of allegations. Once anticipatory bail is granted, police must release the applicant on bail upon arrest. <span className="font-bold text-black">JP Law Suvidha</span> ensures clients understand all conditions and legal obligations attached to bail.
